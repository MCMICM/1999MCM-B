% This is the main script for pedestrian simulation. The simulation is base
% on 1999 MCM outstanding paper from team 375.
%    Team Members: Orion Lawlor, Jason Tedor and Gregg Christopher
%    Paper title:  Room Capacity Analysis Using a Pair of Evacuation Models
%    UMAP Journal;Fall1999, Vol. 20 Issue 3, p321

% The original C++ simulation code of the team 375 can be down from:

% Variables and parameters are defined as below
%   walls    = One straight line segment, comprising a barrier to travel and sight.
%   nwalls   = length(walls), number of walls
%   exits    = An exit is a wall that eats people
%   nexits   = length(exits), number of exits
%   rects    = A piece of rectangle furniture, like a desk
%   nrects   = length(rects), number of rectangle furniture
%   circs    = A piece of round furniture
%   ncircs   = length(circs), number of round furniture
%   pples    = A person is basically a piece of round furniture that moves
%   npples   = length(pples), number of people
%   domain   = [xmin xmax ymin ymax]
%   cells    = 
%   cellsize = cell size
%   ncell    = [nx ny]
%   time     = current time of the system
%   dt       = time step
